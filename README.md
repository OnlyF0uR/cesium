### Programs

Programs, like smart contract, are a set of instructions that act on provided parameters. A program may include state. Programs are written in Selenide (.se for source, and .seh for headers). This code gets compiled to an interpretable medium that is validated and if found valid deployed onchain. Presets are a core functionality of the Selenide Compiler to improve DX and safety. See examples for more information.
